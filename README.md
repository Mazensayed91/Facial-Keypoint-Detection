# Facial-Keypoint-Detection

In this project, I combined computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!

Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. This model is able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face. Some examples of these keypoints are pictured below.
